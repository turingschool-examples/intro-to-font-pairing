* Understand the different between serif and sans serif
* Have an understanding of the structure of letterforms

### How to Make Good Font Pairings

It's hard enough to find one font that looks nice, so how in the world are we supposed to find two? It turns out you can apply many of the same concepts that can help guide you in choose one well constructed, quality font when you're looking for two that pair nicely.

### Form and Structure

The structure of the individual letterforms and how the work together is a key part of assessing prospective typefaces. We're looking at how the parts that come together to form an individual letter are approached, and how those parts come together in the letterforms creating a font.

When assessing suitability for pairing, we can take two approaches looking for similarity in shape and form can be a great place to get started.

As a typography newbie, you'll likely have an easier time finding solid font pairs using the concept of similarity to guide your hunt, and as you begin to feel more confident in your familiarity with typography, you can make more adventurous pairings.

#### Similarity

When finding a font pairing with similar characteristics, we look for different typefaces (perhaps a sans-serif and a serif) that have similar approaches to the structure of the letters and how those letters combine to form words. What are some of the key things that contribute to different typefaces feeling cohesive rather than two separate entities?

* **Cap height:** We want our font pairings to be the same height so they feel visually balanced. Think of it this way: you could overlay a capital letter set in both fonts and it would take up the same space.

* **X-height:** The height of lower case letters can have a huge impact in legibility -- generally, a taller x-height is going to be more legible at small sizes and on screens (for both serif and sans-serif). We want to look for fonts that have a very close x-heights, because it makes it easy for the reader to transition from one to another smoothly.

* **Letter spacing:** Part of a type designer's job is to carefully consider how their typefaces behave in blocks of written text. They spend great care crafting individual letterforms, and then they redouble their efforts while deciding how those individual parts fit together. Well made typefaces have consistent spacing that allows for easy reading and gives a sense of rhythm and cadence to your copy. While these spacing choices can be manually adjusted by the typesetter, if you choose a font with poor, inconsistent spacing, you'll spend far more time making adjustments to compensate for poor type design.

* **Apertures:** Apertures are the openings found in letters like _c_, _a_, and _e_. Open, airy apertures are highly legible and help readers quickly absorb content. Closed apertures are typically less legible, but may be more symmetrical. While we typically favor legibility, a high quality font with closed apertures can absolutely be used with great success, just be aware that it could have an impact on ease of reading and make layout choices appropriately. Look for similar openings in both your typefaces.

* **Letter Width** Like letter spacing, different fonts that have letters of similar widths will feel more closely related than ones that don't. For example, having a very narrow condensed font paired with a very wide font is likely to feel a bit awkward.

* **Styles and Weight** Look for font families that include a true bold and italic set of fonts. You want options, so a good rule of thumb is to look for typefaces with at least 4 styles (usually regular, italic, bold, and bold italic). One of the most common, most terrible crimes against typography is to add a faux italic or bold to it. A true italic font has been specifically developed by the designer, where as a faux italic is physically stretching and warping the letterforms, losing the integrity and spirit of the font. Don't be a type criminal, just use better fonts.
