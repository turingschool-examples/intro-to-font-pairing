* Have an understanding of the structure of letterforms

### How to Make Good Font Pairings

It's hard enough to find one font that looks nice, so how in the world are we supposed to find two? It turns out you can apply many of the same concepts that can help guide you in choose one well constructed, quality font when you're looking for two that pair nicely.

### Form and Structure

The structure of the individual letterforms and how the work together is a key part of assessing prospective typefaces. We're looking at how the parts that come together to form an individual letter are approached, and how those parts come together in the letterforms creating a font.

When assessing suitability for pairing, we can take two approaches: similarity and contrast in shape and form.

#### Similarity

When finding a pairing with similiar characteristics, we look for different typefaces (perhaps a sans-serif and a serif) that have similar approaches to the structure of the letters and how those letters combine to form words. What are the things that contribute to text set in different typefaces feeling like a cohesive whole rather than two separate entities?

A few key elements to look for:

* **Cap height:** We want our font pairings to be the same height so they feel visually balanced. Think of it this way: you could overlay a capital letter set in both fonts and it would take up the same space.

* **X-height:** The height of lower case letters can have a huge impact in legibility -- generally, a taller x-height is going to be more legible at small sizes and on screens (for both serif and sans-serif). We want to look for fonts that have a very close x-heights, because it makes it easy for the reader to transition from one to another smoothly.

* **Letter spacing:** Part of a type designer's job is to carefully consider how their typefaces behave in blocks of written text. They spend great care crafting individual letterforms, and then they redouble their efforts while deciding how those individual parts fit together. Well made typefaces have consistent spacing that allows for easy reading and gives a sense of rhythm and cadence to your copy. While these spacing choices can be manually adjusted by the typesetter, if you choose a font with poor, inconsistent spacing, you'll spend far more time making adjustments to compensate for poor type design.

* **Apertures:** Apertures are the openings found in letters like _c_, _a_, and _e_. Open, airy apertures are highly legible and help readers quickly absorb content. Closed apertures are typically less legible, but may be more symmetrical. While we typically favor legibility, a high quality font with closed apertures can absolutely be used with great success, just be aware that it could have an impact on ease of reading and make layout choices appropriately. Look for similar openings in both your typefaces.

* **Ascenders and Descenders** It can be surprising to see how many different ways an ascender or descender can be approached, both in style and
